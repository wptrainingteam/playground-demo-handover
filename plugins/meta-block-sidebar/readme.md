== Description ==

a custom block that adds two custom meta fields (`team` and `joined`) specifying the person's team name and the date (Month, Year) they joined the company. In this example, we include the block in the `single.html` template file, which displays it on every post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. If you're using another theme, add the "Meta Block Sidebar" block to the relevant template file* (i.e., `/wp-content/themes/blue-note/single.html`).
4. Fill in the two meta fields in the new section added to the sidebar: Team name and the month and year the person joined.
